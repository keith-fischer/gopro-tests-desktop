​Image capture validation

What other validation??
Looping/burst/timelapse/etc.
What can be Automated validation?
​​Studio Importer/uploader
​Pull image set from inserted SDcard
​​Initiates the process & automation
​Brain query/conversion/meta validation
Uploader/cloud validation/download
​​Minimum image spec permutations needed for upload with time restraint
Various image size 10MB/100MB/500MB/1GB/2GB/4GB
​**We need automation mode for process status
​​The UI data grid is nice for manual testing of process status but not for automation
​perhaps both?
​**Status update via JSON file
​Studio importer/uploader Writes status to JSON
Automation reads JSON file
Or use a external REST (node)server
​we need to define the API data protocol
​​​​**Studio UI (OS X,Win) with Accessibility
​​New UI, lets include Accessibility for Studio UI controlled Automation which is supported on platforms Linux/OS X & Windows native
